HUH?

Seriously, ignore this shit.

This directory contains styles used by the examples that are not strictly a part
of DotCore. Feel free to reuse them, modify them, or print them out and eat 
them; just understand that omitting them from your project will have no impact
on the behavior of DotCore.

The only necessary (or strongly suggested) CSS files for a given UI element are 
included the the top-level `css` directory.

WHY THO?
~~~~~~~~
DotCore is a library to provide easy-to-use, best-practices UI functionality.
I started writing it after I got tired of looking for a UI kit that didn't
require me to strip a bunch of unwanted code before I began. It is a set of
"core" functionalities.

Anything but the bare essentials is antithetical to DotCore. As such, pretty 
styles are not a part of its intended scope, and are included in the examples 
only for the sake of my own neurosis.

Now go write some code or whatever.
